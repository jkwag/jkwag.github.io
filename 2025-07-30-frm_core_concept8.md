## ERM
- Enterprise Risk Management manages **entire portfolio** of risks and accounts for
them in **strategic decisions**
- The ERM replaces **silo-based** risk management approach of individual business units

## Benefits
- Captures **diversification**(and concentration) across business lines
- Fully **integerated** risk management committee and CRO
  - Integrated with firm's risk appetite
- Develops **consistent risk metrics** across business units
- More accurate **risk aggregation**
- Possible **economies of scale** when deploying risk transfer(hedging)
- Allows **optimization** of risk/reward in risk management strategy choices
  - Can make dollar savings through using captive insurance
- Risk management integrated with **corporate strategy**

## Best Practice
- A strong ERM framework has five important dimensions
  1. Targets: Setting limits and risk appetite
  2. Structure: Has to do with CRO/board
  3. Identification and metrics
  4. ERM strategies: How do we hedge and transfer
  5. **Risk culture**: Attitude/Tone at the top

## Risk Culture Characteristics
- The risk culture of a firm are the **goals,customs,values,and beliefs**(both implicit and explicit) that influence the behaviors of employees
- Four key risk culture indicators
  1. Accountability
  2. Effective communication and challenge: Whilstleblowing
  3. Incentives
  4. Tone from the top

## Risk Culture Challenges
1. Risk indicator or risk level?
   - Could the indicator be compromised?
2. Education for everyone?
   - Can the board link the top 10 enterprise risks to risk appetite?
3. Time and Space
   - Do the same attitudes pervade across divisions and over time?
4. Culture cycle
   - True risk culture only really revealed in a crisis(Under stress)
5. Curse of data
   - Is big data a blessing, or does it slow us down?

## ERM Risk Identification tools
- Sensitivity testing
  - Changing **key variables** to assess impact
- Stress testing
  - Exploring **extremely negative** situations(historical,hypothetical)
- Scenario analysis
  - Considers **causes and impact** of negative events(qualitative reflection)

## Scenario Analysis
- Since the financial crisis of 2007-2009, regulators have required banks to show they can withstand more severe **dynamic negative events**
- US stress testing of banks began in 2009 with the **inital supervisory capital assessment program(SCAP)**
- Since 2011, FED requires annual stress tests under Dodd Frank framework
  - DFAST for **banks > USD 10 Billion**
  - CCAR for **banks > USD 50 Billion**
     - Three supervisory scenarios: Baseline, Adverse, Severely adverse
     - Bank must project financial position over next nine quarters
     - Must maintain a **Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6%**
       - Could be facilitated by issuing **Cocos(contingent convertible bonds)**

## The Future
- Risk is **multidimensional** and requires **holistic thinking**
  - Need to incorporate **ambiguity**
  - Importance of **risk culture** should be embraced
- Risk can jump across risk types and markets
  - Must be integrated into **strategic decision-making**
- Numbers and judgement will transform risk management
  - Without transparency in AI -> Increased **Model risk**
- **Behavioral finance** can explain **irrational behavior**
  - Anchoring and referencing
  - Home bias
  - Feedback effects
  - Loss aversion
  - Framing
  - Mental accounting
  - Groupthink
  - Ostrich effect
  - Herding
