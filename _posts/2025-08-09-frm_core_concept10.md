# How financial crisis occurred during 2007-2009

## Interest rates
- Interest rates were kept low and there was easy access to credit, which fueled
a **rapid increase in house prices**

## Factors
- The move to the **OTD**(Originate-to-distribute) model meant that **banks relaxed their
lending standards**, thus fueling **growth in subprime lending**
- Institutions increasingly funded themselves using **short-term facilities**, increasing liquidity risk
- Lehmann brothers default caused a **loss of confidence with banks** refusing to lend to each other and ultimately requiring central banks to intervene

## Subprime mortages
- residential loans to **borrowers of high risk**
- securitized and repackaged as **CDOs**(collateralizaed debt obligations)
  - had much higher credit rating, hiding **the true risk of the underlying assets**
  - difficult to understand and value -> market participants were **unable to properly value CDOs**

## OTD
- banks relaxed their lending standards beyond reason
- Brokers focused on **qunatity rather than quality** in search of higher commission
- **Rating agentcies** provided unrealistically **high ratings**, in relation to **senior CDO tranches** backed by subprime mortgages

## ABCP and repos
- funded their long-term assets via short-term funding sources such as **asset-backed commercial paper and repos**
  - exposed them to significant funding liquidity risk
  - Decline in house prices led to short-term lenders **refusing to roll over their loans** -> a near shutdown of the financial market

## Systemic risk
- Central banks around the world intervened by **lowering interest rates and providing liquidity support**
- Came at the cost of massive increases in central bank balance sheets
