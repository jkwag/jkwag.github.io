## Risk Management Strategies

Four Risk Management Strategies

1. Accept(Retain) the risk
2. Avoid the risk
3. Mitigate the risk
4. Transfer the risk

Easy way to remember: ARM Teeth

**Risk acceptance** can be done to include a risk factor in company performance 
or because the risk being passed through to customers. If risk is retained, then
it may be desirable to **mitigate it through deal enhancement**(i.e., more collateral on a loan
or investing in new technology to offset a known risk). Risk can also be **transferred to a third party**, but this 
introduces **counterparty risk** into the equation.

## Risk appetite
A firm's risk appetite is **its willingness to retain risk**. Usually influenced by
everyone from line managers right on up to senior managers. The firm will map
known risks and determine their potential **magnitude, timing, and location**. 
Once the risks have been mapped, **senior managers and the board of directors** can establish enterprise-level risk tolerance levels,
that need to be **monitored and peridically reassessed**.

## Hedging operational risk and financial risk
Hedging operational risks attempts to **insulate revenues and expenses from unplanned risk**.
Could involve **the cost of inputs or the currency** impact on domestic performance.

Financial risk refers to **balance sheet items like assets and liabilities**.
Controlling these risks may involve **interest rate hedging**. Companies have to decide if they plan to deal with them in a **static or dynamic manner**.

## Rightsizing risk management
Should be rightsized by determining **which limits to impose and which risks to retain**.
Deravatives could be used to manage risk, including: **forward contracts, futures contracts, swap contract, call option contracts,
put option contracts, exotic option contracts, and swaption contracts**. Important that a firm understand the benefits and drawbacks associated with relative to the status
as either **exchange-traded or OTC**.
