## Lessons from financial crisis of 2007-2009
- **The needs of all the firms'stakeholders** must be considered
- The board needs to have competent and **independent directors**
- The board needs to take a **highly proactive role** in the firm's risk management process
- The firm's risk appetite needs to be **clearly articulated by the board**
- **Compensation** should be structured to better **align management behavior with long-term stakeholder priorities** as determined by the board

**Basel III and the Dodd-Frank Act** were also issued in response to the crisis. Goals are 
to focus banks on **capital adequacy measures** and to **prevent commercial banks from engaing in proprietary trading**.

## Best Practices for risk management
- Corporate governance
  - Board member independence
  - Competency standards for board members
  - Consideration of all stakeholders
  - Structuring managerial compesation packages
  - Separation between the CEO and the chairperson of the board -> True accountability
  - Board -> supervise the risk management process
- Adequately mapping risks and specifying an enterprise-level risk appetite, communicated throughout the organization

## BOD and Commiittee related to risk management
- **The board of directors** has ultimate responsibility for ERM(enterprise-level risk management)
- if the board does not have sufficient expertise, then need to recruit a **risk advisory director**, an independent expert in industry-specific risk factors) to the board and to the risk management committee
- **The risk management committee** will make all **risk appetite decisions** and then bring these discussions back to the full board
- **The compensation committee** is charged with **aligning managerial compensation with long-term stakeholder needs**.

## How risk appetite should be set
- A firm's risk appetite must **fit with its business strategy**
  - involves an in-depth understanding of the **firm's strategy**
- Sometimes the risk appetite will **limit available opportunities**
  - Declining a loan due to risk limits
- Compensation should also be aligned to encourage long-term risk awareness and not reward only short-term profit-seeking behaviors

## Interconnection of functional units
- Senior management, business units, finance and operation functions, and risk management
all work together to conduct the firm's risk management process
- **Frontline managers are vital in the process and the CRO communicates progress to senior management and the risk committee** on a very regular basis.

## Audit Committee
- Members traditionally **monitor compliance with accounting standards**
- Role to play in **supervision of risk management policies**
- Need to verify that **policies are being followed and offer opinions on the variables** used in testing exposures, as well as the functional value of the systems
- Opinions informed by internal auditors and are collected and **transferred to the full board** for further consideration
