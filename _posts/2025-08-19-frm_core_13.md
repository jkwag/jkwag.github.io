## PMF,CDF
- A PMF,f(x), gives us the probability that a **discrete random variable will take on the value x**
- A CDF,F(x), gives us the probability that a X will take on **a value less than or equal to x**

## Expected value
- The expected value of a discrete random variable is the **probability-weighted average of the possible outcomes**

## Moments
- Four commonly used moments
  - Mean
    - Expected value of the random variable
  - Variance
    - A measure of dispersion
  - Skewness
    - A measure of symmetry
  - Kurtosis
    - A measure of the proportion of the outcomes in the tails of the distribution

## PMF, PDF
- PMF provides the probability of a **discrete** random variable
- PDF provides the probability of a **continuous** random variable

## Quantile
- The percentage of outcomes less than a given outcome
- Q(x) provides the value of an outcome which is greater than x% of all possible outcomes
- Interquartile range is an **interval that includes the central 50%** of all possible outcomes

## Linear transformation
- For a variable Y = a + bX
  - E(Y) = a + bE(X)
  - $\sigma^2_{Y} = b^2\sigma^{2}_{x}$
  - skew Y = skew X, for b > 0 , and skew Y = -skew X, for b < 0
  - kurtosis Y = kurtosis X
