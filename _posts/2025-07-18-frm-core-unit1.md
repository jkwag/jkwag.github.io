## Risk Management

Risk arises from the uncertainty regarding an entity's future losses as well as 
future gains. **Risk Management** includes the sequence of activities aimed to **reduce
or eliminate** an entity's potential to incur expected losses. **Risk taking** refers to the active
assumption of incremental risk to generate incremental gains.

The risk management process consists of actions to determine if the perceived reward justifies the expected risks.

Four components of risk management
  1. Identify risks
  2. Analyze and measure risks
  3. Evaluate the impact from risk events
  4. Manage risks

## VaR and Economic Capital

They are two ways that risk managers can attempt to **quantify risk**. Some of the qualitative methods
include **scenario analysis and stress testing**. Need to be careful that enterprise-level risk
cannot be reduced to a single number. Risk is a complex concept that requires a **dynamic process** to identify,measure,mitigate, and monitor relevant risks.

## Expected Losses

The average loss expected over a given time horizon. 

They are a function of
  - The probability of a risk occuring
  - The dolloar exposure to the risk event
  - The expected severity of the loss if the risk event does occur

Unexpected losses are losses that **exceed the average result expected**.

## Trade-off between risk and reward

Opportunities with **lower risk** have **lower reward potential**. Risk managers need to consider
the granular loss drivers that underpin a given risk. Sometimes corporate insider goals conflict with those of shareholders.
This could drive risk taking that results in an extreme unexpected losses. **Multiple layers of supervision along with periodict and independent internal audits** can help to avoid these conflictcs of interest.

## Subcategories of risks

#### Market risk
- potential losses from changes in **financial market levels or volatility**

#### Credit risk
- the risk of **deafult on a loan**

#### Liquidity risk
- Not having access to enough money to meet business needs
- Could also flow from an **inability to quickly exchange a financial asset for cash**

#### Operational risk
- involves losses from **inadequate internal processes, human error, external event**.

#### Legal and regulatory risk
- the threat of **litigation** or the threat of unfavorable **government actions**

#### Business risk
- variability in either **revenue or input cost**

#### Strategic risk
- uncertainty surrounding **long-term business strategy**

#### Reputation risk
- loss of sales due to a decline in **public perception**

## Risk aggregation and RAROC
Some risks are correlated, potentially leading to a domino effect where one risk leads
directly to another risk, amplifying risk exposures. Risk aggregation is the process of consider risk at the **enterprise level**.
Higher complexity of the underlying risks will lead to **less reliability of risk assumptions**.

**VaR and the associated economic capital measurement** are both useful metrics that provide information.
A RAROC can be calculated for **comparison** purposes, but VaR should not be considered as a stand-alone risk metric since it makes
certain assumptions, can be adjusted by input parameters, and there are different types of measurements.
They can be useful to better understand **the aggregate risk exposure** of a firm.
