## APT

- The CAPM(Capital Asset Pricing Model) measures the expected return of a financial asset
**with respect to the broad market** only
- APT(Arbitrage pricing theory) is a type of **multifactor model** that expands upon the CAPM
to **any number of macroeconomic factors** taht may add additional explanatory power to the expected returns of a financial asset
- No factors set to consider , presenting analysts with great **flexibility** 
- Also has **simplified  assumptions** relative to the CAPM

## Possible inputs
- Series of factors that **influence the return on a stock**
- include the expected return for the stock, a series of desired factors, and a beta for each factor

## Diversification
- A **single factor** model will only consider the impact of one factor on a dependent variable, leaving the potential for either company-specific risk or uncaptured systematic risk to influence asset returns
- A **multifactor** model enables analysts to better model **the impact of all systematic risk exposures** to improve forecasting ability
- **Diversification** is based on **correlation between constituent assets** held in a portfolio
- If sourced from **the same class, correlations will be higher** than with different asset classes
-  Multifactor models are ideal for the need to monitor a diverse list of factors

## Exposure Elimination
- **Multifactor models** consider exposures on a very granular level, investors can use this approach for heding
- A specific factor exposure can be target for elimination, or all factor exposures can be targeted
- Through the creation of a customized hedged **portfolio that is scaled to the factor sensitivities of a specific portfolio**, investors can potentially **isolate arbitrage opportunities**

## Farma-French Model
- They specified a three factor model
  - Equity risk premium
  - The size of the firm(Small Minus Big)
  - The firm's valuation(High Minus Low)
- Other extensions are there as well like including a **momentum factor**
