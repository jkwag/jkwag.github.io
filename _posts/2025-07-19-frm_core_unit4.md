## Derativative products
- Three derivative products helped to transfer credit risk(risk of a borrower defaulting) leading up to a financial crisis
- CDS(Credit Default Swaps)
  - enable an investor to transfer credit risk on a loan product to an insurance company
  - pay a quarterly insurance premium to buy downside protection
- CDO(Collateralized debt obligations)
  - enable loan originators to repackage loan products into large baskets of loans -> resell those bundles of loans
  - to investors on the secondary markets
  - a structured product that is organized in tranches with differing exposures to default risk
- CLO(Collateralized loan obligations)
  - very similar to a CDO except that it holds primarily underwritten bank loans as opposed to the mortgage bias of CDOs

 ## Traditional approaches to credit risk exposures
- Purchasing third-party insurance
- Exposure netting
- marking-to-market
- requiring collateral
- incuding termination clauses
- possible loan reassignment
- Syndicating a loan
 - a lead bank retains some of the loan and find other banks to hold the remainder of the desired loan amount

## What caused financial crisis
- The existence of credit deravatives did not cause the financial crisis, but **the misuse of the products did**
  - Investors used CDS contracts for **speculation rather than risk mitigation**
  - CDOs also held a very **complex mixture of mortgages that included both subprime loans and adjustable-rate loans** as well
- Perfect storm when the FED began rising rates, adjustable-rate loans attained their reset date and produced unaffordable payments
- The housing market declined, causing home prices to drop -> Massive **defaults that rippled through the MBS and CDO markets**
- Banks became relucant to lend to each other while some were going bankrupt
- **Dodd-Frank** was formed to better **regulate the credit deravatives space** and to keep bank trading in check
- SEC also added **Section 15G** to further protect investors

## Securitization process
- First involving a bank sourcing loans
- Transferring them to an off-balance sheet entity known as a **SPV(Special Purpose Vehicle)**
- Organize the loans into **tranches**
- Selling the structured loan products to investors

#### Issue
  - **OTD(Originate-to-distribute)** model sources **loans with low quality**. disguising the fact from investors

#### Advantages
  - Securitization can **enhance loan access**
  - help banks to **increase profitability**
  - provide investors with **diversification opportunities**
