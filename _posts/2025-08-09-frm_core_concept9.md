## Interest rate risk
- flows from **fluctuations in interest rate levels**
- S&L crisis in the 1980s highlighted the **veracity of interest rate risk**
- Banks **received deposits from customers** and then **lent that money for longer-term loans**
  - Capture the **interest rate spread** between the short-term rates that they paid and the long-term rates that they received
  - When short-term interest rates were raised by the FED, S&Ls **lost their profit center**
  - Many **entered into riskier loans** to make up the difference -> Collapse of their industry that required a federal bailout
  - Risk mitigation tools available in the form of **duration matching between assets and liabilities**

## Liquidity risk
- The potential for loss that results from **short-term funding issues**
- e.g. Collapses of Lehman Brothers, Continental Illinois, and Northern Rock
- funded long-term assets with short-term funding sources
  - When the short-term funding was no longer available due to external events, crisis occurred
  - Banks must **balance the need to reduce the need to reduce liquidity risk with the cost of doing so**

## Hedging strategy
- A firm must choose between **a static hedge** and a **dynamic hedge**
- Static hedge
  - Easy to implement but difficult to calibrate to changing market conditions
- Dynamic hedge
  - Flexible but presents liquidity risk when long-term liabilities are hedge with **short-term deravatives**
  - MGRM is one of the risk cases

## Model risk
- Making improper assumptions -> Niederhoffer, LTCM(VaR, need to conduct stress testing)
- Measuring relationships the wrong way
- Deploying the wrong model overall
- Adjusting assimptions or valuation models to make bad decisions look better -> London Whale

## Rogue Trader
- Barings bank
  - used accounting tricks to hide substantial losses
  - Could have been prevented with better internal controls flowing out of a healthy skepticism

## Financial engineering
- Involves the use of forwards, futures, swaps, options, and securitized products to hedge risk
- Could hedge a single risk or a combination of risks depending upon the hedging tool chosen
- Risk managers should be aware of the **temptation to migrate from a true hedging strategy to a speculative one**
- e.g. Bankers Trust, Orange County, Sachsen Landesbank

## Reputation risk
- potential for a **negative operational outcome as a result of a negative fact or rumor**
- Three big constituents
  - Customers
  - Regulators
  - Shareholders

## Corporate governance
- System of policies and procedures that direct how a firm is operated
- Enron scandal
  - Chairman of the board and the CEO were the same person
  - Management engaged in unethical behaviors
    - Misuses of SPVs
    - Creative accounting through aggressive revenue techniques
  - Sarbanes-Oxley to prevent it

## Cyber risk
- risk of financial or reputational loss due to a **cyberattack on internal technology infrastructure**
- SWIFT case
